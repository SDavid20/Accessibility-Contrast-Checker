This is my final project for Code in Place 2024.
As a product designer passionate about accessibility, I decided to create a contrast checker that verifies if two colors meet the World Wide Web Consortium guidelines for accessibility.
This tool is especially useful for individuals with visual impairments.
Text contrast is tested against its background, yielding a specific number based on the text's relative luminance.
Resulting numbers are checked against the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) guidelines.
You can see more details [here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum) 
And[ here ](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G17.html)

I am looking to work on it's UI in the future. I'd love to get your feedback
