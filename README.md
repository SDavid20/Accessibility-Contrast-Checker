This is my final project in Code in Place 2024, a program offered by Stanford University
As a product designer passionate about accessibility, I created a contrast checker to ensure color combinations meet Web Accessibility Standards usage in text.
This tool is particularly beneficial for users with visual impairments, evaluating text contrast against its background using relative luminance measurements.
Text contrast is tested against its background, yielding a specific number based on the text's relative luminance.
The results are compared against the guidelines set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which you can explore further 
[here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum) and [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G17.html). 

In the future, I plan to work on it's user interface (UI) so it is simpler to use for many people
I would greatly appreciate your feedback on the project.
